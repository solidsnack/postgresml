Petabyte-sized Postgres deployments are documented in production since at least 2008, and recent patches have enabled working beyond exabyte and up to the yotabyte scale. Machine learning models can be horizontally scaled using standard Postgres replicas. How reliable can this be? Postgres is widely considered mission critical, and some of the most reliable technology in any modern stack. PostgresML allows an infrastructure organization to leverage pre-existing best practices to deploy machine learning into production with less risk and effort than other systems. For example, model backup and recovery happens automatically alongside normal Postgres data backup. How good are the models? Model quality is often a trade-off between compute resources and incremental quality improvements. Sometimes a few thousands training examples and an off the shelf algorithm can deliver significant business value after a few seconds of training. PostgresML allows stakeholders to choose several different algorithms to get the most bang for the buck, or invest in more computationally intensive techniques as necessary. In addition, PostgresML automatically applies best practices for data cleaning like imputing missing values by default and normalizing data to prevent common problems in production. PostgresML doesn't help with reformulating a business problem into a machine learning problem. Like most things in life, the ultimate in quality will be a concerted effort of experts working over time. PostgresML is intended to establish successful patterns for those experts to collaborate around while leveraging the expertise of open source and research communities. Is PostgresML fast? Collocating the compute with the data inside the database removes one of the most common latency bottlenecks in the ML stack, which is the (de)serialization of data between stores and services across the wire. Modern versions of Postgres also support automatic query parrellization across multiple workers to further minimize latency in large batch workloads. Finally, PostgresML will utilize GPU compute if both the algorithm and hardware support it, although it is currently rare in practice for production databases to have GPUs.

The changes seemed sublte, but they were enough to create chaos: most projects and tools out there written in Python 2 would no longer work under Python 3. The next decade was spent migrating mission-critical infrastructure from print to print() and from str to bytes . Some just gave up and stayed on Python 2. Breaking backwards compatibility to make progress could be good but Python's move was risky. It endured because we loved it more than we disagreed with that change. Most projects won't have that luxury, especially if you're just starting out. For us at PostgresML, backwards compatibility is as important as progress. PostgresML 2.0 is coming out soon and we're rewritten everything in Rust for a 35x performance improvement . The previous version was written in Python, the de facto machine learning environment with the most libraries. Now that we were using Linfa and SmartCore, we could have theoretically went ahead without Python, but we weren't quite ready to let go of all the functionality provided by the Python ecosystem, and I'm sure many of our users weren't either. So what could we do to preserve features, backwards compatibility, and our users' trust? PyO3 to the rescue. Python in Rust \u00b6 PyO3 was written to build Python extensions in Rust. Native extensions are much faster than Python modules so, when speed matters, most things were written in Cython or C. If you've ever tried that, you know the experience isn't very user-friendly or forgiving. Rust, on the other hand, is fast and memory-safe, with compiler hints getting awfully specific (my co-founder thinks it may be becoming a singularity). PyO3 comes with another very important feature: it allows running Python code from inside a Rust program. Sounds too good to be true? We didn't think so at the time. PL/Python has been doing that for years and that's what we used initially to write PostgresML. The path to running Scikit inside Rust seemed clear. The Roadmap \u00b6 Making a massive Python library work under a completely different environment isn't an obvious thing to do. If you dive into Scikit's source code, you would find Python, Cython, C extensions and SciPy. We were going to add that into a shared library which linked into Postgres and implemented its own machine learning algorithms. In order to get this done, we split the work into two distinct steps: Train a model in Rust using Scikit Test for regressions using our 1.0 test suite Hello Python, I am Rust \u00b6 First thing we needed to do was to make sure Scikit can even run under PyO3. So we wrote a small wrapper around all the algorithms we implemented in 1.0 and called it from inside our Rust source code. The wrapper was just 200 lines of code most of which was mapping algorithm names to Scikit's Python classes. Using the wrapper was surprisingly easy: use pyo3 :: prelude :: * ; use pyo3 :: types :: PyTuple ; pub fn sklearn_train () { // Copy the code into the Rust library at build time. let module = include_str! ( concat! ( env! ( \"CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR\" ), \"/src/bindings/sklearn.py\" )); let estimator = Python :: with_gil ( | py | -> Py < PyAny > { // Compile Python let module = PyModule :: from_code ( py , module , \"\" , \"\" ). unwrap (); // ... train the model }); } Our Python code was compiled and ready to go. We trained a model with data coming from Rust arrays, passed into Python using PyO3 automatic conversions, and got back a trained Scikit model. It felt magical. Did it Work? \u00b6 Since we have dozens of ML algorithms in 1.0, we had a pretty decent test suite to make sure all of them worked. My local dev is an Ubuntu 22.04 gaming rig (I still dual-boot though), so I had no issues running the test suite, training all Scikit algorithms on the toy datasets, and getting predictions back in a good amount of time. Drunk on my success, I called the job done, merged the PR, and moved on. Then Montana decided to try my work on his slightly older gaming rig, but instead of getting a trained model, he got this: server closed the connection unexpectedly This probably means the server terminated abnormally before or while processing the request. and after checking the logs, he found an even scarier message: LOG: server process (PID 11352) was terminated by signal 11: Segmentation fault A segmentation fault in Rust? That's supposed to be impossible, but here it was. A segmentation fault happens when a program attempts to read parts of memory that don't exist, either because they were freed, or were never allocated in the first place. That doesn't happen in Rust under normal conditions, but we knew our project was far from normal. More confusingly, the error was coming from inside Scikit. It would have made sense if it was XGBoost or LightGBM, which we wrapped with a bunch of Rust unsafe blocks, but the error was coming from a universally used Python library. Debugging Ten Layers Down \u00b6 Debugging segmentation faults inside compiled executables is hard. Debugging segmentation faults inside shared libraries inside FFI wrappers inside a machine learning library running inside a database... is harder. We've had very few clues: it worked on my Ubuntu 22.04 but didn't on Montana's Ubuntu 20.04. I dual-booted 20.04 to check it out and, surprise, it segfaulted for me too. At this point I was convinced something was terribly wrong and called the \"universal debugger\" to the rescue: I littered Scikit's code with raise Exception(\"I'm here\") to see where it was going and, more importantly, where it couldn't make it because of the segfault. After a few hours, I was inside SciPy, over 10 function calls deep from our wrapper. SciPy implements many useful scientific computing subroutines and one of them happens to solve linear regressions, a very popular machine learning algorithm. SciPy doesn't do it alone but calls out to a BLAS subroutine written to crunch numbers as fast as possible, and that's where I found the segfault. It clicked. Scikit uses SciPy, SciPy uses C-BLAS and we used OpenBLAS for ndarray and our own vector functions, and everything is dynamically linked together at compile time. So which BLAS is SciPy using? It couldn't find the BLAS function it needed and crashed. Static Link or Bust \u00b6 The fix was surprisingly simple: statically link OpenBLAS using the Cargo build script: build.rs fn main () { println! ( \"cargo:rustc-link-lib=static=openblas\" ); } The linker included the code for OpenBLAS into our extension, SciPy was able to find the function it was looking for, and PostgresML 2.0 was working again. Recap \u00b6 In the end, we got what we wanted: Rust machine learning in Postgres was on track Scikit-learn was coming along into PostgresML 2.0 Backwards compatibility with PostgresML 1.0 was preserved and we had a lot of fun working with PyO3 and pushing the limits of what we thought was possible.

Professional Data Scientists need teams of Data Engineers to move data from production databases into data warehouses and denormalized schemas, which are more familiar and ideally easier to work with. Large offline batch jobs are a typical integration point between Data Scientists and their Engineering counterparts, who primarily deal with online systems. As the systems grow more complex, additional specialized Machine Learning Engineers are required to optimize performance and scalability bottlenecks between databases, warehouses, models and applications. This eventually leads to expensive maintenance and terminal complexity: new improvements to the system become exponentially more difficult.

Montana Low August 31, 2022 Normalized data is a powerful tool leveraged by 10x engineering organizations. If you haven't read Postgres Full Text Search is Good Enough! you should, unless you're willing to take that statement at face value, without the code samples to prove it. We'll go beyond that claim in this post, but to reiterate the main points, Postgres supports: Stemming Ranking / Boost Multiple languages Fuzzy search for misspelling Accent support This is good enough for most of the use cases out there, without introducing any additional concerns to your application. But, if you've ever tried to deliver relevant search results at scale, you'll realize that you need a lot more than these fundamentals. ElasticSearch has all kinds of best in class features, like a modified version of BM25 that is state of the art (developed in the 1970's), which is one of the many features you need beyond the Term Frequency (TF) based ranking that Postgres uses... but, the ElasticSearch approach is a dead end for 2 reasons: Trying to improve search relevance with statistics like TF-IDF and BM25 is like trying to make a flying car. What you want is a helicopter instead. Computing Inverse Document Frequency (IDF) for BM25 brutalizes your search indexing performance, which leads to a host of follow on issues via distributed computation , for the originally dubious reason. What we were promised Academics have spent decades inventing many algorithms that use orders of magnitude more compute eking out marginally better results that often aren't worth it in practice. Not to generally disparage academia, their work has consistently improved our world, but we need to pay attention to tradeoffs. SQL is another acronym similiarly pioneered in the 1970's. One difference between SQL and BM25 is that everyone has heard of the former before reading this blog post, for good reason. If you actually want to meaningfully improve search results, you generally need to add new data sources. Relevance is much more often revealed by the way other things relate to the document, rather than the content of the document itself. Google proved the point 23 years ago. Pagerank doesn't rely on the page content itself as much as it uses metadata from links to the pages . We live in a connected world and it's the interplay among things that reveal their relevance, whether that is links for websites, sales for products, shares for social posts... It's the greater context around the document that matters. If you want to improve your search results, don't rely on expensive O(n*m) word frequency statistics. Get new sources of data instead. It's the relational nature of relevance that underpins why a relational database forms the ideal search engine. Postgres made the right call to avoid the costs required to compute Inverse Document Frequency in their search indexing, given its meager benefit. Instead, it offers the most feature-complete relational data platform. Elasticsearch will tell you , that you can't join data in a naively distributed system at read time, because it is prohibitively expensive. Instead you'll have to join the data eagerly at indexing time, which is even more prohibitively expensive. That's good for their business since you're the one paying for it, and it will scale until you're bankrupt. What you really should do, is leave the data normalized inside Postgres, which will allow you to join additional, related data at query time. It will take multiple orders of magnitude less compute to index and search a normalized corpus, meaning you'll have a lot longer (potentially forever) before you need to distribute your workload, and then maybe you can do that intelligently instead of naively. Instead of spending your time building and maintaining pipelines to shuffle updates between systems, you can work on new sources of data to really improve relevance. With PostgresML, you can now skip straight to full on machine learning when you have the related data. You can load your feature store into the same database as your search corpus. Each data source can live in its own independent table, with its own update cadence, rather than having to reindex and denormalize entire documents back to ElasticSearch, or worse, large portions of the entire corpus, when a single thing changes. With a single SQL query, you can do multiple passes of re-ranking, pruning and personalization to refine a search relevance score. basic term relevance embedding similarities XGBoost or LightGBM inference These queries can execute in milliseconds on large production-sized corpora with Postgres's multiple indexing strategies. You can do all of this without adding any new infrastructure to your stack. The following full blown example is for demonstration purposes only of a 3 rd generation search engine. You can test it for real in the PostgresML Gym to build up a complete understanding.

The number of technologies and the amount of required hardware compete for tightening headcount, hosting, and latency budgets. Unfortunately, the trend in the industry is only getting worse along these lines, with increased usage of state-of-the-art architectures that center around data warehouses, microservices and NoSQL databases. PostgresML is a simpler alternative to that ever-growing complexity. In this post, we explore some additional performance benefits of a more elegant architecture and discover that PostgresML outperforms traditional Python microservices by a factor of 8 in local tests and by a factor of 40 on AWS EC2. Candidate architectures \u00b6 To consider Python microservices with every possible advantage, our first benchmark is run with Python and Redis located on the same machine. Our goal is to avoid any additional network latency, which puts it on a more even footing with PostgresML. Our second test takes place on AWS EC2, with Redis and Gunicorn separated by a network; this benchmark proves to be relatively devastating. The full source code for both benchmarks is available on Github . PostgresML \u00b6 PostgresML architecture is composed of: A PostgreSQL server with PostgresML v2.0 pgbench SQL client Python \u00b6 Python architecture is composed of: A Flask/Gunicorn server accepting and returning JSON CSV file with the training data Redis feature store with the inference dataset, serialized with JSON ab HTTP client ML \u00b6 Both architectures host the same XGBoost model, running predictions against the same dataset. See Methodology for more details. Results \u00b6 Throughput \u00b6 Throughput is defined as the number of XGBoost predictions the architecture can serve per second. In this benchmark, PostgresML outperformed Python and Redis, running on the same machine, by a factor of 8 . In Python, most of the bottleneck comes from having to fetch and deserialize Redis data. Since the features are externally stored, they need to be passed through Python and into XGBoost. XGBoost itself is written in C++, and it's Python library only provides a convenient interface. The prediction coming out of XGBoost has to go through Python again, serialized as JSON, and sent via HTTP to the client. This is pretty much the bare minimum amount of work you can do for an inference microservice. PostgresML, on the other hand, collocates data and compute. It fetches data from a Postgres table, which already comes in a standard floating point format, and the Rust inference layer forwards it to XGBoost via a pointer. An interesting thing happened when the benchmark hit 20 clients: PostgresML throughput starts to quickly decrease. This may be surprising to some, but to Postgres enthusiasts it's a known issue: Postgres isn't very good at handling more concurrent active connections than CPU threads. To mitigate this, we introduced PgBouncer (a Postgres proxy and pooler) in front of the database, and the throughput increased back up, and continued to hold as we went to 100 clients. It's worth noting that the benchmarking machine had only 16 available CPU threads (8 cores). If more cores were available, the bottleneck would only occur with more clients. The general recommendation for Postgres servers it to open around 2 connections per available CPU core, although newer versions of PostgreSQL have been incrementally chipping away at this limitation. Why throughput is important \u00b6 Throughput allows you to do more with less. If you're able to serve 30,000 queries per second using a single machine, but only using 1,000 today, you're unlikely to need an upgrade anytime soon. On the other hand, if the system can only serve 5,000 requests, an expensive and possibly stressful upgrade is in your near future. Latency \u00b6 Latency is defined as the time it takes to return a single XGBoost prediction. Since most systems have limited resources, throughput directly impacts latency (and vice versa). If there are many active requests, clients waiting in the queue take longer to be serviced, and overall system latency increases. In this benchmark, PostgresML outperformed Python by a factor of 8 as well. You'll note the same issue happens at 20 clients, and the same mitigation using PgBouncer reduces its impact. Meanwhile, Python's latency continues to increase substantially. Latency is a good metric to use when describing the performance of an architecture. In other words, if I were to use this service, I would get a prediction back in at most this long, irrespective of how many other clients are using it. Why latency is important \u00b6 Latency is important in machine learning services because they are often running as an addition to the main application, and sometimes have to be accessed multiple times during the same HTTP request. Let's take the example of an e-commerce website. A typical storefront wants to show many personalization models concurrently. Examples of such models could include \"buy it again\" recommendations for recurring purchases (binary classification), or \"popular items in your area\" (geographic clustering of purchase histories) or \"customers like you bought this item\" (nearest neighbour model). All of these models are important because they have been proven, over time, to be very successful at driving purchases. If inference latency is high, the models start to compete for very expensive real estate, front page and checkout, and the business has to drop some of them or, more likely, suffer from slow page loads. Nobody likes a slow app when they are trying to order groceries or dinner. Memory utilization \u00b6 Python is known for using more memory than more optimized languages and, in this case, it uses 7 times more than PostgresML. PostgresML is a Postgres extension, and it shares RAM with the database server. Postgres is very efficient at fetching and allocating only the memory it needs: it reuses shared_buffers and OS page cache to store rows for inference, and requires very little to no memory allocation to serve queries. Meanwhile, Python must allocate memory for each feature it receives from Redis and for each HTTP response it returns. This benchmark did not measure Redis memory utilization, which is an additional and often substantial cost of running traditional machine learning microservices. Training \u00b6 Since Python often uses Pandas to load and preprocess data, it is notably more memory hungry. Before even passing the data into XGBoost, we were already at 8GB RSS (resident set size); during actual fitting, memory utilization went to almost 12GB. This test is another best case scenario for Python, since the data has already been preprocessed, and was merely passed on to the algorithm. Meanwhile, PostresML enjoys sharing RAM with the Postgres server and only allocates the memory needed by XGBoost. The dataset size was significant, but we managed to train the same model using only 5GB of RAM. PostgresML therefore allows training models on datasets at least twice as large as Python, all the while using identical hardware. Why memory utilization is important \u00b6 This is another example of doing more with less. Most machine learning algorithms, outside of FAANG and research universities, require the dataset to fit into the memory of a single machine. Distributed training is not where we want it to be, and there is still so much value to be extracted from simple linear regressions. Using less RAM allows to train larger and better models on larger and more complete datasets. If you happen to suffer from large machine learning compute bills, using less RAM can be a pleasant surprise at the end of your fiscal year. What about UltraJSON/MessagePack/Serializer X? \u00b6 We spent a lot of time talking about serialization, so it makes sense to look at prior work in that field. JSON is the most user-friendly format, but it's certainly not the fastest. MessagePack and Ultra JSON, for example, are sometimes faster and more efficient at reading and storing binary information. So, would using them in this benchmark be better, instead of Python's built-in json module? The answer is: not really. Time to (de)serialize is important, but ultimately needing (de)serialization in the first place is the bottleneck. Taking data out of a remote system (e.g. a feature store like Redis), sending it over a network socket, parsing it into a Python object (which requires memory allocation), only to convert it again to a binary type for XGBoost, is causing unnecessary delays in the system. PostgresML does one in-memory copy of features from Postgres. No network, no (de)serialization, no unnecessary latency. What about the real world? \u00b6 Testing over localhost is convenient, but it's not the most realistic benchmark. In production deployments, the client and the server are on different machines, and in the case of the Python + Redis architecture, the feature store is yet another network hop away. To demonstrate this, we spun up 3 EC2 instances and ran the benchmark again. This time, PostgresML outperformed Python and Redis by a factor of 40 . Network gap between Redis and Gunicorn made things worse...a lot worse. Fetching data from a remote feature store added milliseconds to the request the Python architecture could not spare. The additional latency compounded, and in a system that has finite resources, caused contention. Most Gunicorn threads were simply waiting on the network, and thousands of requests were stuck in the queue. PostgresML didn't have this issue, because the features and the Rust inference layer live on the same system. This architectural choice removes network latency and (de)serialization from the equation. You'll note the concurrency issue we discussed earlier hit Postgres at 20 connections, and we used PgBouncer again to save the day. Scaling Postgres, once you know how to do it, isn't as difficult as it sounds. Methodology \u00b6 Hardware \u00b6 Both the client and the server in the first benchmark were located on the same machine. Redis was local as well. The machine is an 8 core, 16 threads AMD Ryzen 7 5800X with 32GB RAM, 1TB NVMe SSD running Ubuntu 22.04. AWS EC2 benchmarks were done with one c5.4xlarge instance hosting Gunicorn and PostgresML, and two c5.large instances hosting the client and Redis, respectively. They were located in the same VPC. Configuration \u00b6 Gunicorn was running with 5 workers and 2 threads per worker. Postgres was using 1, 5 and 20 connections for 1, 5 and 20 clients, respectively. PgBouncer was given a default_pool_size of 10, so a maximum of 10 Postgres connections were used for 20 and 100 clients. XGBoost was allowed to use 2 threads during inference, and all available CPU cores (16 threads) during training. Both ab and pgbench use all available resources, but are very lightweight; the requests were a single JSON object and a single query respectively. Both of the clients use persistent connections, ab by using HTTP Keep-Alives, and pgbench by keeping the Postgres connection open for the duration of the benchmark. ML \u00b6 Data \u00b6 We used the Flight Status Prediction dataset from Kaggle. After some post-processing, it ended up being about 2 GB of floating point features. We didn't use all columns because some of them are redundant, e.g. airport name and airport identifier, which refer to the same thing. Model \u00b6 Our XGBoost model was trained with default hyperparameters and 25 estimators (also known as boosting rounds). Data used for training and inference is available here . Data stored in the Redis feature store is available here . It's only a subset because it was taking hours to load the entire dataset into Redis with a single Python process (28 million rows). Meanwhile, Postgres COPY only took about a minute. PostgresML model is trained with: SELECT * FROM pgml . train ( project_name => 'r2' , algorithm => 'xgboost' , hyperparams => '{ \"n_estimators\": 25 }' ); It had terrible accuracy (as did the Python version), probably because we were missing any kind of weather information, the latter most likely causing delays at airports.

In this benchmark, PostgresML outperformed Python and Redis, running on the same machine, by a factor of 8 . In Python, most of the bottleneck comes from having to fetch and deserialize Redis data. Since the features are externally stored, they need to be passed through Python and into XGBoost. XGBoost itself is written in C++, and it's Python library only provides a convenient interface. The prediction coming out of XGBoost has to go through Python again, serialized as JSON, and sent via HTTP to the client. This is pretty much the bare minimum amount of work you can do for an inference microservice. PostgresML, on the other hand, collocates data and compute. It fetches data from a Postgres table, which already comes in a standard floating point format, and the Rust inference layer forwards it to XGBoost via a pointer. An interesting thing happened when the benchmark hit 20 clients: PostgresML throughput starts to quickly decrease. This may be surprising to some, but to Postgres enthusiasts it's a known issue: Postgres isn't very good at handling more concurrent active connections than CPU threads. To mitigate this, we introduced PgBouncer (a Postgres proxy and pooler) in front of the database, and the throughput increased back up, and continued to hold as we went to 100 clients. It's worth noting that the benchmarking machine had only 16 available CPU threads (8 cores). If more cores were available, the bottleneck would only occur with more clients. The general recommendation for Postgres servers it to open around 2 connections per available CPU core, although newer versions of PostgreSQL have been incrementally chipping away at this limitation.","title":"Throughput"},{"location":"blog/postgresml-is-8x-faster-than-python-http-microservices/#why-throughput-is-important","text":"Throughput allows you to do more with less. If you're able to serve 30,000 queries per second using a single machine, but only using 1,000 today, you're unlikely to need an upgrade anytime soon.

Since most systems have limited resources, throughput directly impacts latency (and vice versa). If there are many active requests, clients waiting in the queue take longer to be serviced, and overall system latency increases. In this benchmark, PostgresML outperformed Python by a factor of 8 as well. You'll note the same issue happens at 20 clients, and the same mitigation using PgBouncer reduces its impact. Meanwhile, Python's latency continues to increase substantially. Latency is a good metric to use when describing the performance of an architecture. In other words, if I were to use this service, I would get a prediction back in at most this long, irrespective of how many other clients are using it.","title":"Latency"},{"location":"blog/postgresml-is-8x-faster-than-python-http-microservices/#why-latency-is-important","text":"Latency is important in machine learning services because they are often running as an addition to the main application, and sometimes have to be accessed multiple times during the same HTTP request. Let's take the example of an e-commerce website. A typical storefront wants to show many personalization models concurrently. Examples of such models could include \"buy it again\" recommendations for recurring purchases (binary classification), or \"popular items in your area\" (geographic clustering of purchase histories) or \"customers like you bought this item\" (nearest neighbour model). All of these models are important because they have been proven, over time, to be very successful at driving purchases. If inference latency is high, the models start to compete for very expensive real estate, front page and checkout, and the business has to drop some of them or, more likely, suffer from slow page loads. Nobody likes a slow app when they are trying to order groceries or dinner.","title":"Why latency is important"},{"location":"blog/postgresml-is-8x-faster-than-python-http-microservices/#memory-utilization","text":"Python is known for using more memory than more optimized languages and, in this case, it uses 7 times more than PostgresML. PostgresML is a Postgres extension, and it shares RAM with the database server. Postgres is very efficient at fetching and allocating only the memory it needs: it reuses shared_buffers and OS page cache to store rows for inference, and requires very little to no memory allocation to serve queries. Meanwhile, Python must allocate memory for each feature it receives from Redis and for each HTTP response it returns. This benchmark did not measure Redis memory utilization, which is an additional and often substantial cost of running traditional machine learning microservices.","title":"Memory utilization"},{"location":"blog/postgresml-is-8x-faster-than-python-http-microservices/#training","text":"Since Python often uses Pandas to load and preprocess data, it is notably more memory hungry. Before even passing the data into XGBoost, we were already at 8GB RSS (resident set size); during actual fitting, memory utilization went to almost 12GB. This test is another best case scenario for Python, since the data has already been preprocessed, and was merely passed on to the algorithm. Meanwhile, PostresML enjoys sharing RAM with the Postgres server and only allocates the memory needed by XGBoost. The dataset size was significant, but we managed to train the same model using only 5GB of RAM. PostgresML therefore allows training models on datasets at least twice as large as Python, all the while using identical hardware.","title":"Training"},{"location":"blog/postgresml-is-8x-faster-than-python-http-microservices/#why-memory-utilization-is-important","text":"This is another example of doing more with less. Most machine learning algorithms, outside of FAANG and research universities, require the dataset to fit into the memory of a single machine. Distributed training is not where we want it to be, and there is still so much value to be extracted from simple linear regressions. Using less RAM allows to train larger and better models on larger and more complete datasets. If you happen to suffer from large machine learning compute bills, using less RAM can be a pleasant surprise at the end of your fiscal year.","title":"Why memory utilization is important"},{"location":"blog/postgresml-is-8x-faster-than-python-http-microservices/#what-about-ultrajsonmessagepackserializer-x","text":"We spent a lot of time talking about serialization, so it makes sense to look at prior work in that field. JSON is the most user-friendly format, but it's certainly not the fastest. MessagePack and Ultra JSON, for example, are sometimes faster and more efficient at reading and storing binary information. So, would using them in this benchmark be better, instead of Python's built-in json module? The answer is: not really. Time to (de)serialize is important, but ultimately needing (de)serialization in the first place is the bottleneck. Taking data out of a remote system (e.g. a feature store like Redis), sending it over a network socket, parsing it into a Python object (which requires memory allocation), only to convert it again to a binary type for XGBoost, is causing unnecessary delays in the system. PostgresML does one in-memory copy of features from Postgres. No network, no (de)serialization, no unnecessary latency.","title":"What about UltraJSON/MessagePack/Serializer X?"},{"location":"blog/postgresml-is-8x-faster-than-python-http-microservices/#what-about-the-real-world","text":"Testing over localhost is convenient, but it's not the most realistic benchmark. In production deployments, the client and the server are on different machines, and in the case of the Python + Redis architecture, the feature store is yet another network hop away. To demonstrate this, we spun up 3 EC2 instances and ran the benchmark again. This time, PostgresML outperformed Python and Redis by a factor of 40 . Network gap between Redis and Gunicorn made things worse...a lot worse. Fetching data from a remote feature store added milliseconds to the request the Python architecture could not spare. The additional latency compounded, and in a system that has finite resources, caused contention. Most Gunicorn threads were simply waiting on the network, and thousands of requests were stuck in the queue. PostgresML didn't have this issue, because the features and the Rust inference layer live on the same system. This architectural choice removes network latency and (de)serialization from the equation. You'll note the concurrency issue we discussed earlier hit Postgres at 20 connections, and we used PgBouncer again to save the day.

We recently released v1.0 and now we're considering what we want to accomplish for v2.0. In addition to simplifying the workflow for building models, we'd like to address runtime speed, memory consumption and the overall reliability we've seen is needed for machine learning deployments running at scale. Python is generally touted as fast enough for machine learning, and is the de facto industry standard with tons of popular libraries, implementing all the latest and greatest algorithms. Many of these algorithms (Torch, Tensorflow, XGboost, NumPy) have been optimized in C, but not all of them. For example, most of the linear algorithms in scikit-learn are written in pure Python, although they do use NumPy, which is a convenient optimization. It also uses Cython in a few performance critical places. This ecosystem has allowed PostgresML to offer a ton of functionality with minimal duplication of effort. Ambition Starts With a Simple Benchmark \u00b6 Rust mascot image by opensource.com To illustrate our motivation, we'll create a test set of 10,000 random embeddings with 128 dimensions, and store them in a table.

Rust comes close to the hand-optimized assembly version of the Basic Linear Algebra Subroutines (BLAS) implementation. NumPy is supposed to provide optimizations in cases like this, but it's actually the worst performer. Data movement from Postgres to PL/Python is pretty good; it's even faster than the pure SQL equivalent, but adding the extra conversion from Python list to Numpy array takes almost as much time as everything else.

It really streamlines creating an extension in Rust, so all we have to worry about is writing our functions. It took about an hour to port all of our vector operations to Rust with BLAS support, and another week to port all the \"business logic\" for maintaining model training and deployment. We've even gained some new capabilities for caching models across connections (independent processes), now that we have access to Postgres shared memory, without having to worry about Python's GIL and GC. This is the dream of Apache's Arrow project, realized for our applications, without having to change the world, just our implementations. \ud83e\udd29 Single-copy end-to-end machine learning, with parallel processing and shared data access. What about XGBoost and friends? \u00b6 ML isn't just about basic math and a little bit of business logic. It's about all those complicated algorithms beyond linear regression for gradient boosting and deep learning. The good news is that most of these libraries are implemented in C/C++, and just have Python bindings. There are also bindings for Rust ( lightgbm , xgboost , tensorflow , torch ). Layers of abstraction must remain a good value. The results are somewhat staggering. We didn't spend any time intentionally optimizing Rust over Python. Most of the time spent was just trying to get things to compile. \ud83d\ude05 It's hard to believe the difference is this big, but those fringe operations outside of the core machine learning algorithms really do dominate, requiring up to 35x more time in Python during inference. The difference between classification and regression speeds here are related to the dataset size. The scikit learn handwritten image classification dataset effectively has 64 features (pixels) vs the diabetes regression dataset having only 10 features. The more data we're dealing with, the bigger the improvement we see in Rust . We're even giving Python some leeway by warming up the runtime on the connection before the test, which typically takes a second or two to interpret all of PostgresML's dependencies. Since Rust is a compiled language, there is no longer a need to warmup the connection. This language comparison uses in-process data access. Python based machine learning microservices that communicate with other services over HTTP with JSON or gRPC interfaces will look even worse in comparison, especially if they are stateless and rely on yet another database to provide their data over yet another wire. Preserving Backward Compatibility \u00b6 train.sql 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT pgml . train ( project_name => 'Handwritten Digit Classifier' , task => 'classification' , relation_name => 'pgml.digits' , y_column_name => 'target' , algorithm => 'xgboost' ); train.sql 1 2 SELECT pgml . predict ( 'Handwritten Digit Classifier' , image ) FROM pgml . digits ; The API is identical between v1.0 and v2.0. We take breaking changes seriously and we're not going to break existing deployments just because we're rewriting the whole project. The only reason we're bumping the major version is because we feel like this is a dramatic change, but we intend to preserve a full compatibility layer with models trained on v1.0 in Python. However, this does mean that to get the full performance benefits, you'll need to retrain models after upgrading. Ensuring High Quality Rust Implementations \u00b6 Besides backwards compatibility, we're building a Python compatibility layer to guarantee we can preserve the full Python model training APIs, when Rust APIs are not at parity in terms of functionality, quality or performance. We started this journey thinking that the older vanilla Python algorithms in Scikit would be the best candidates for replacement in Rust, but that is only partly true. There are high quality efforts in linfa and smartcore that also show 10-30x speedup over Scikit, but they still lack some of the deeper functionality like joint regression, some of the more obscure algorithms and hyperparameters, and some of the error handling that has been hardened into Scikit with mass adoption. We see similar speed up in prediction time for the Rust implementations of classic algorithms. The Rust implementations also produce high quality predictions against test sets, although there is not perfect parity in the implementations where different optimizations have been chosen by default. Interestingly, the training times for some of the simplest algorithms are worse in the Rust implementation. Until we can guarantee each Rust algorithm is an upgrade in every way, we'll continue to use the Python compatibility layer on a case by case basis to avoid any unpleasant surprises. We believe that machine learning in Rust is mature enough to add significant value now. We'll be using the same underlying C/C++ libraries, and it's worth contributing to the Rust ML ecosystem to bring it up to full feature parity. Our v2.0 release will include a benchmark suite for the full API we support via all Python libraries, so that we can track our progress toward pure Rust implementations over time.

Layers of abstraction must remain a good value. The results are somewhat staggering. We didn't spend any time intentionally optimizing Rust over Python. Most of the time spent was just trying to get things to compile. \ud83d\ude05 It's hard to believe the difference is this big, but those fringe operations outside of the core machine learning algorithms really do dominate, requiring up to 35x more time in Python during inference. The difference between classification and regression speeds here are related to the dataset size. The scikit learn handwritten image classification dataset effectively has 64 features (pixels) vs the diabetes regression dataset having only 10 features. The more data we're dealing with, the bigger the improvement we see in Rust . We're even giving Python some leeway by warming up the runtime on the connection before the test, which typically takes a second or two to interpret all of PostgresML's dependencies. Since Rust is a compiled language, there is no longer a need to warmup the connection. This language comparison uses in-process data access. Python based machine learning microservices that communicate with other services over HTTP with JSON or gRPC interfaces will look even worse in comparison, especially if they are stateless and rely on yet another database to provide their data over yet another wire.","title":"What about XGBoost and friends?"},{"location":"blog/postgresml-is-moving-to-rust-for-our-2.0-release/#preserving-backward-compatibility","text":"train.sql 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT pgml . train ( project_name => 'Handwritten Digit Classifier' , task => 'classification' , relation_name => 'pgml.digits' , y_column_name => 'target' , algorithm => 'xgboost' ); train.sql 1 2 SELECT pgml . predict ( 'Handwritten Digit Classifier' , image ) FROM pgml . digits ; The API is identical between v1.0 and v2.0.

There are high quality efforts in linfa and smartcore that also show 10-30x speedup over Scikit, but they still lack some of the deeper functionality like joint regression, some of the more obscure algorithms and hyperparameters, and some of the error handling that has been hardened into Scikit with mass adoption. We see similar speed up in prediction time for the Rust implementations of classic algorithms. The Rust implementations also produce high quality predictions against test sets, although there is not perfect parity in the implementations where different optimizations have been chosen by default. Interestingly, the training times for some of the simplest algorithms are worse in the Rust implementation.

There is a good reason for it though, because most businesses plan for success. If your app, online store, or SaaS becomes popular, you want to be sure that the system powering it can serve all your new customers. At PostgresML, we are very concerned with scale. Our engineering background took us through scaling PostgreSQL to 100 TB+, so we're certain that it scales, but could we scale machine learning alongside it? In this post, we'll discuss how we horizontally scale PostgresML to achieve more than 1 million XGBoost predictions per second on commodity hardware. If you missed our previous post and are wondering why someone would combine machine learning and Postgres, take a look at our PostgresML vs. Python benchmark . Architecture Overview \u00b6 If you're familiar with how one runs PostgreSQL at scale, you can skip straight to the results . Part of our thesis, and the reason why we chose Postgres as our host for machine learning, is that scaling machine learning inference is very similar to scaling read queries in a typical database cluster. Inference speed varies based on the model complexity (e.g. n_estimators for XGBoost) and the size of the dataset (how many features the model uses), which is analogous to query complexity and table size in the database world and, as we'll demonstrate further on, scaling the latter is mostly a solved problem. System Architecture Component Description Clients Regular Postgres clients ELB Elastic Network Load Balancer PgCat A Postgres pooler with built-in load balancing, failover, and sharding Replica Regular Postgres replicas Primary Regular Postgres primary Our architecture has four components that may need to scale up or down based on load: Clients Load balancer PgCat pooler Postgres replicas We intentionally don't discuss scaling the primary in this post, because sharding, which is the most effective way to do so, is a fascinating subject that deserves its own series of posts. Spoiler alert: we sharded Postgres without any problems. Clients \u00b6 Clients are regular Postgres connections coming from web apps, job queues, or pretty much anywhere that needs data. They can be long-living or ephemeral and they typically grow in number as the application scales. Most modern deployments use containers which are added as load on the app increases, and removed as the load decreases. This is called dynamic horizontal scaling, and it's an effective way to adapt to changing traffic patterns experienced by most businesses. Load Balancer \u00b6 The load balancer is a way to spread traffic across horizontally scalable components, by routing new connections to targets in a round robin (or random) fashion. It's typically a very large box (or a fast router), but even those need to be scaled if traffic suddenly increases. Since we're running our system on AWS, this is already taken care of, for a reasonably small fee, by using an Elastic Load Balancer. PgCat \u00b6 Meow. All your Postgres belong to me. If you've used Postgres in the past, you know that it can't handle many concurrent connections. For large deployments, it's necessary to run something we call a pooler. A pooler routes thousands of clients to only a few dozen server connections by time-sharing when a client can use a server. Because most queries are very quick, this is a very effective way to run Postgres at scale. There are many poolers available presently, the most notable being PgBouncer, which has been around for a very long time, and is trusted by many large organizations. Unfortunately, it hasn't evolved much with the growing needs of highly available Postgres deployments, so we wrote our own which added important functionality we needed: Load balancing of read queries Failover in case a read replica is broken Sharding (this feature is still being developed) In this benchmark, we used its load balancing feature to evenly distribute XGBoost predictions across our Postgres replicas. Postgres Replicas \u00b6 Scaling Postgres reads is pretty straight forward. If more read queries are coming in, we add a replica to serve the increased load. If the load is decreasing, we remove a replica to save money. The data is replicated from the primary, so all replicas are identical, and all of them can serve any query, or in our case, an XGBoost prediction. PgCat can dynamically add and remove replicas from its config without disconnecting clients, so we can add and remove replicas as needed, without downtime. Parallelizing XGBoost \u00b6 Scaling XGBoost predictions is a little bit more interesting. XGBoost cannot serve predictions concurrently because of internal data structure locks. This is common to many other machine learning algorithms as well, because making predictions can temporarily modify internal components of the model. PostgresML bypasses that limitation because of how Postgres itself handles concurrency: PostgresML concurrency PostgreSQL uses the fork/multiprocessing architecture to serve multiple clients concurrently: each new client connection becomes an independent OS process. During connection startup, PostgresML loads all models inside the process' memory space. This means that each connection has its own copy of the XGBoost model and PostgresML ends up serving multiple XGBoost predictions at the same time without any lock contention. Results \u00b6 We ran over a 100 different benchmarks, by changing the number of clients, poolers, replicas, and XGBoost predictions we requested. The benchmarks were meant to test the limits of each configuration, and what remediations were needed in each scenario. Our raw data is available below . One of the tests we ran used 1,000 clients, which were connected to 1, 2, and 5 replicas. The results were exactly what we expected. Linear Scaling \u00b6 Both latency and throughput, the standard measurements of system performance, scale mostly linearly with the number of replicas. Linear scaling is the north star of all horizontally scalable systems, and most are not able to achieve it because of increasing complexity that comes with synchronization. Our architecture shares nothing and requires no synchronization. The replicas don't talk to each other and the poolers don't either. Every component has the knowledge it needs (through configuration) to do its job, and they do it well. The most impressive result is serving close to a million predictions with an average latency of less than 1ms. You might notice though that 950160.7 isn't quite one million, and that's true. We couldn't reach one million with 1000 clients, so we increased to 2000 and got our magic number: 1,021,692.7 req/sec , with an average latency of 1.7ms . Batching Predictions \u00b6 Batching is a proven method to optimize performance. If you need to get several data points, batch the requests into one query, and it will run faster than making individual requests. We should precede this result by stating that PostgresML does not yet have a batch prediction API as such. Our pgml.predict() function can predict multiple points, but we haven't implemented a query pattern to pass multiple rows to that function at the same time. Once we do, based on our tests, we should see a substantial increase in batch prediction performance. Regardless of that limitation, we still managed to get better results by batching queries together since Postgres needed to do less query parsing and searching, and we saved on network round trip time as well. If batching did not work at all, we would see a linear increase in latency and a linear decrease in throughput. That did not happen; instead, we got a 1.5x improvement by batching 5 predictions together, and a 1.2x improvement by batching 20. A modest success, but a success nonetheless. Graceful Degradation and Queuing \u00b6 All systems, at some point in their lifetime, will come under more load than they were designed for; what happens then is an important feature (or bug) of their design. Horizontal scaling is never immediate: it takes a bit of time to spin up additional hardware to handle the load. It can take a second, or a minute, depending on availability, but in both cases, existing resources need to serve traffic the best way they can. We were hoping to test PostgresML to its breaking point, but we couldn't quite get there. As the load (number of clients) increased beyond provisioned capacity, the only thing we saw was a gradual increase in latency. Throughput remained roughly the same. This gradual latency increase was caused by simple queuing: the replicas couldn't serve requests concurrently, so the requests had to patiently wait in the poolers. \"What's taking so long over there!?\" Among many others, this is a very important feature of any proxy: it's a FIFO queue (first in, first out). If the system is underutilized, queue size is 0 and all requests are served as quickly as physically possible. If the system is overutilized, the queue size increases, holds as the number of requests stabilizes, and decreases back to 0 as the system is scaled up to accommodate new traffic. Queueing overall is not desirable, but it's a feature, not a bug. While autoscaling spins up an additional replica, the app continues to work, although a few milliseconds slower, which is a good trade off for not overspending on hardware. As the demand on PostgresML increases, the system gracefully handles the load. If the number of replicas stays the same, latency slowly increases, all the while remaining well below acceptable ranges. Throughput holds as well, as increasing number of clients evenly split available resources. If we increase the number of replicas, latency decreases and throughput increases, as the number of clients increases in parallel. We get the best result with 5 replicas, but this number is variable and can be changed as needs for latency compete with cost. What's Next \u00b6 Horizontal scaling and high availability are fascinating topics in software engineering. Needing to serve 1 million predictions per second is rare, but having the ability to do that, and more if desired, is an important aspect for any new system. The next challenge for us is to scale writes horizontally. In the database world, this means sharding the database into multiple separate machines using a hashing function, and automatically routing both reads and writes to the right shards. There are many possible solutions on the market for this already, e.g. Citus and Foreign Data Wrappers, but none are as horizontally scalable as we like, although we will incorporate them into our architecture until we build the one we really want. For that purpose, we're building our own open source Postgres proxy which we discussed earlier in the article. As we progress further in our journey, we'll be adding more features and performance improvements. By combining PgCat with PostgresML, we are aiming to build the next generation of machine learning infrastructure that can power anything from tiny startups to unicorns and massive enterprises, without the data ever leaving our favorite database. Methodology \u00b6 ML \u00b6 This time, we used an XGBoost model with 100 trees: SELECT * FROM pgml . train ( 'flights' , task => 'regression' , relation_name => 'flights_mat_3' , y_column_name => 'depdelayminutes' , algorithm => 'xgboost' , hyperparams => '{\"n_estimators\": 100 }' , runtime => 'rust' ); and fetched our predictions the usual way: SELECT pgml . predict ( 'flights' , ARRAY [ year , quarter , month , distance , dayofweek , dayofmonth , flight_number_operating_airline , originairportid , destairportid , flight_number_marketing_airline , departure ] ) AS prediction FROM flights_mat_3 LIMIT :limit ; where :limit is the batch size of 1, 5, and 20. Model \u00b6 The model is roughly the same as the one we used in our previous post , with just one extra feature added, which improved R 2 a little bit. Hardware \u00b6 Client \u00b6 The client was a c5n.4xlarge box on EC2. We chose the c5n class to have the 100 GBit NIC, since we wanted it to saturate our network as much as possible. Thousands of clients were simulated using pgbench . PgCat Pooler \u00b6 PgCat, written in asynchronous Rust, was running on c5.xlarge machines (4 vCPUs, 8GB RAM) with 4 Tokio workers. We used between 1 and 35 machines, and scaled them in increments of 5-20 at a time. The pooler did a decent amount of work around parsing queries, making sure they are read-only SELECT s, and routing them, at random, to replicas. If any replica was down for any reason, it would route around it to remaining machines. Postgres Replicas \u00b6 Postgres replicas were running on c5.9xlarge machines with 36 vCPUs and 72 GB of RAM. The hot dataset fits entirely in memory. The servers were intentionally saturated to maximum capacity before scaling up to test queuing and graceful degradation of performance. Raw Results \u00b6 Raw latency data is available here and raw throughput data is available here . Call to Early Adopters \u00b6 PostgresML and PgCat are free and open source.

None of those systems however expect your data to be safe. In fact, if it's gone, your product should be able to go on like nothing really happened. For those deployments, machine learning and other features it powers, are treated as just a nice to have. ScyllaDB (and friends) \u00b6 Scylla is the new kid on the block, at least as far as databases go. It's been around for 6 years, but it's making headlines with large deployments like Discord 2 and Expedia 3 . It takes the idea that key-value stores can be fast, and if you have a power outage, your data remains safe and replicated across availability zones of your favorite cloud. To top it all off, it uses Cassandra's SQL syntax and client/server protocol, so you might think that it can actually power your business-critical systems. At its heart though Scylla is still a key-value store. We can put things in, but getting them back out in a way that makes sense will still prove to be a challenge. It does have secondary indexes, so if you want to find your users by email instead of by primary key one day, you still might be able to, it'll just be slower. Ultimately though, with no join support or foreign keys, Scylla tables, much like Redis keys, are isolated from each other. So finding out how many of your customers in San Francisco have ordered your best selling shoes will require an expensive data warehouse instead of a GROUP BY city ORDER BY COUNT(*) . You might think DynamoDB, MongoDB, and all other SQL look-alikes 6 are better, but they are all forgetting one important fact. Denormalized Data is DOA \u00b6 Relationships are the foundation of everything, ranging from personal well-being to having a successful business. Most problems we'll run into involve understanding how entities work together. Which users logged in today? That's a relationship between users, logins and time. How many users bought our top selling product? How much did that product cost to deliver? Those are relationships between prices, products, date ranges, users, and orders. If we denormalize this data, by either flattening it into a key-value store or just storing it in independent tables in different databases, we lose the ability to query it in interesting ways, and if we lose that, we stop understanding our business. PostgreSQL \u00b6 Okay, that was a bit of a spoiler. When looking at our options, one has to wonder, why can't we have our cake and eat it too? That's a bad analogy though, because we're not asking for that much and we certainly can have it. When it comes to reliability, there is no better option. PostgreSQL does not lose data. In fact, it has several layers of failure checks 4 to ensure that bytes in equals bytes out. When installed on modern SSDs, PostgreSQL can serve 100k+ write transactions per second without breaking a sweat, and push 1GB/second write throughput. When it comes to reads, it can serve datasets going into petabytes and is horizontally scalable into millions of reads per second. That's better than web scale 5 . Most importantly though, Postgres allows you to understand your data and your business. With just a few joins, you can connect users to orders to chargebacks and to your website visits. You don't need a data warehouse, Spark, Cassandra, large pipelines to make them all work together or data validation scripts. You can read, write and understand straight from the source. In Comes Machine Learning \u00b6 Understanding your business is good, but what if you could improve it too? Most are tempted to throw spaghetti against the wall (and that's okay), but machine learning allows for a more scientific approach. Traditionally, ML has been tough to use with modern data architectures: using key-value databases makes data virtually inaccessible in bulk. With PostgresML though, you can train an XGBoost model directly on your orders table with a single SQL query: SELECT pgml . train ( 'Orders Likely To Be Returned' , -- name of your model 'regression' , -- objective (regression or classification) 'public.orders' , -- table 'refunded' , -- label (what are we predicting) 'xgboost' -- algorithm ); SELECT pgml . predict ( 'Orders Likely To Be Returned' , ARRAY [ orders . * ]) AS refund_likelihood , orders . * FROM orders ORDER BY refund_likelyhood DESC LIMIT 100 ; Checkmate.

If you haven't already, sign up for our Gym to get a free hosted PostgresML instance you can use to follow this tutorial. You can also run one yourself by following the instructions in our Github repo. Try PostgresML Once you have your PostgresML instance running, we'll be ready to get started. Get data \u00b6 The first part of machine learning is getting your data in a format you can use. That's usually the hardest part, but thankfully we have a few example datasets we can use. To load one of them, navigate to the IDE tab and run this query: SELECT * FROM pgml . load_dataset ( 'diabetes' ); You should see something like this: We have more example Scikit datasets available: iris (classification), digits (classification), wine (regression), To load them into PostgresML, use the same function above with the desired dataset name as parameter. They will become available in the pgml schema as pgml.iris , pgml.digits and pgml.wine respectively. Browse data \u00b6 The SQL editor you just used can run arbitrary queries on the PostgresML instance. For example, if we want to see what dataset we just loaded looks like, we can run: SELECT * FROM pgml . diabetes LIMIT 5 ; The diabetes dataset is a toy (small, not realistic) dataset published by Scikit Learn. It contains ten feature columns and one label column: Column Description Data type age The age of the patient (in years). float sex The sex of the patient (normalized). float bmi The BMI Body Mass index. float bp Average blood pressure of the patient. float s1 Total serum cholesterol. float s2 Low-density lipoproteins. float s3 High-density lipoproteins. float s4 Total cholesterol / HDL. float s5 Possibly log of serum triglycerides level. float s6 Blood sugar level. float target Quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline. float This dataset is not realistic because all data is perfectly arranged and normalized, which won't be the case with most real world datasets you'll run into, but it's perfect for our quick tutorial. Alright, we're ready to do some machine learning! First project \u00b6 PostgresML organizes itself into projects. A project is just a name for model(s) trained on a particular dataset. Let's create our first project by training an XGBoost regression model on our diabetes dataset. Using the IDE, run: SELECT * FROM pgml . train ( 'My First Project' , task => 'regression' , relation_name => 'pgml.diabetes' , y_column_name => 'target' , algorithm => 'xgboost' ); You should see this: By executing pmgl.train() we did the following: created a project called \"My First Project\", snapshotted the table pgml.diabetes thus making the experiment reproducible (in case data changes, as it happens in the real world), trained an XGBoost regression model on the data contained in the pgml.diabetes table using the column target as the label, deployed the model into production. We're ready to predict novel data points! Inference \u00b6 Inference is the act of predicting labels that we haven't necessarily used in training. That's the whole point of machine learning really: predict something we haven't seen before. Let's try and predict some new values. Using the IDE, run: SELECT pgml . predict ( 'My First Project' , ARRAY [ 0 . 06 , -- age 0 . 05 , -- sex 0 . 05 , -- bmi - 0 . 0056 , -- bp 0 . 012191 , -- s1 - 0 . 043401 , -- s2 0 . 034309 , -- s3 - 0 . 031938 , -- s4 - 0 . 061988 , --s5 - 0 . 031988 -- s6 ] ) AS prediction ; You should see something like this: The prediction column represents the possible value of the target column given the new features we just passed into the pgml.predict() function. You can just as easily predict multiple points and compare them to the actual labels in the dataset: SELECT pgml . predict ( 'My First Project 2' , ARRAY [ age , sex , bmi , bp , s1 , s3 , s3 , s4 , s5 , s6 ]), target FROM pgml . diabetes LIMIT 10 ; Sometimes the model will be pretty close, but sometimes it will be way off. That's why we'll be training several of them and comparing them next. Browse around \u00b6 By creating our first project, we made the Dashboard a little bit more interesting. This is how the pgml.diabetes snapshot we just created looks like: As you can see, we automatically performed some analysis on the data. Visualizing the data is important to understand how it could potentially behave given different models, and maybe even predict how it could evolve in the future. XGBoost is a good algorithm, but what if there are better ones? Let's try training a few more using the IDE. Run these one at a time: -- Simple linear regression. SELECT * FROM pgml . train ( 'My First Project' , algorithm => 'linear' ); -- The Lasso (much fancier linear regression). SELECT * FROM pgml . train ( 'My First Project' , algorithm => 'lasso' ); If you navigate to the Models tab, you should see all three algorithms you just trained: Huh, apparently XGBoost isn't as good we originally thought! In this case, a simple linear regression did significantly better than all the others. It's hard to know which algorithm will perform best given a dataset; even experienced machine learning engineers get this one wrong. With PostgresML, you needn't worry: you can train all of them and see which one does best for your data. PostgresML will automatically use the best one for inference. Conclusion \u00b6 Congratulations on becoming a Machine Learning engineer. If you thought ML was scary or mysterious, we hope that this small tutorial made it a little bit more approachable. This is the first of many tutorials we'll publish, so stay tuned.

SELECT * FROM pgml . train ( 'My First Project' , algorithm => 'lasso' ); If you navigate to the Models tab, you should see all three algorithms you just trained: Huh, apparently XGBoost isn't as good we originally thought! In this case, a simple linear regression did significantly better than all the others. It's hard to know which algorithm will perform best given a dataset; even experienced machine learning engineers get this one wrong. With PostgresML, you needn't worry: you can train all of them and see which one does best for your data. PostgresML will automatically use the best one for inference.","title":"Browse around"},{"location":"gym/quick_start/#conclusion","text":"Congratulations on becoming a Machine Learning engineer.

It works the same way as pgml.predict() in all other respects. Many machine learning algorithms can benefit from calculating predictions in one operation instead of many, and batch predictions can be 3-6 times faster, for large datasets, than pgml.predict() . API \u00b6 The API for batch predictions is very similar to individual predictions, and only requires two arguments: the project name and the aggregated features used for predictions. pgml.predict_batch() pgml . predict_batch ( project_name TEXT , features REAL [] ) Parameters \u00b6 Parameter Description Example project_name The project name used to train models in pgml.train() . My first PostgresML project features An aggregate of feature vectors used to predict novel data points. array_agg(image) Example SELECT pgml . predict_batch ( 'My First PostgresML Project' , array_agg ( ARRAY [ 0.1 , 2.0 , 5.0 ] ) ) AS prediction FROM pgml . digits Note that we are passing the result of array_agg() to our function because we want Postgres to accumulate all the features first, and only give it to PostgresML in one function call. Collecting Results \u00b6 Batch predictions have to be fetched in a subquery or a CTE because they are using the array_agg() aggregate. To get the results back in an easily usable form, pgml.predict_batch() returns a setof result instead of a normal array, and that can be then built into a table: SQL Output WITH predictions AS ( SELECT pgml . predict_batch ( 'My Classification Project' , array_agg ( image ) ) AS prediction , unnest ( array_agg ( target ) ) AS target FROM pgml . digits WHERE target = 0 ) SELECT prediction , target FROM predictions LIMIT 10 ; prediction | target ------------+-------- 0 | 0 0 | 0 0 | 0 0 | 0 0 | 0 0 | 0 0 | 0 0 | 0 0 | 0 0 | 0 (10 rows) Since we're using aggregates, one must take care to place limiting predicates into the WHERE clause of the CTE. For example, we used WHERE target = 0 to batch predict images which are only classified into the 0 class. Joins \u00b6 To perform a join on batch predictions, it's necessary to have a uniquely identifiable join column for each row.

We've outlined three of the built-in mechanisms to help distribute the load. pg_dump (< 10GB) \u00b6 pg_dump is a standard tool used to export data from a PostgreSQL database. If your dataset is small (e.g. less than 10GB) and changes infrequently, this could be quickest and simplest way to do it. Example # Export data from your production DB pg_dump \\ postgres://username:password@production-database.example.com/production_db \\ --no-owner \\ -t table_one \\ -t table_two > dump.sql # Import the data into PostgresML psql \\ postgres://username:password@postgresml.example.com/postgresml_db \\ -f dump.sql If you're using our Docker stack, you can import the data there: psql \\ postgres://postgres@localhost:5433/pgml_development \\ -f dump.sql PostgresML tables and functions are located in the pgml schema, so you can safely import your data into PostgresML without conflicts. You can also use pg_dump to copy the pgml schema to other servers which will make the trained models available in a distributed fashion. Foreign Data Wrappers (10GB - 100GB) \u00b6 Foreign Data Wrappers, or FDWs for short, are another good tool for reading or importing data from another PostgreSQL database into PostgresML. Setting up FDWs is a bit more involved than pg_dump but they provide real time access to your production data and are good for small to medium size datasets (e.g. 10GB to 100GB) that change frequently. Official PostgreSQL docs explain FDWs with more detail; we'll document a basic example below. Install the extension \u00b6 PostgreSQL comes with postgres_fdw already available, but the extension needs to be explicitly installed into the database. Connect to your PostgresML database as a superuser and run: CREATE EXTENSION postgres_fdw ; Create foreign server \u00b6 A foreign server is a FDW reference to another PostgreSQL database running somewhere else. In this case, that foreign server is your production database. CREATE SERVER your_production_db FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw OPTIONS ( host 'production-database.example.com' , port '5432' , dbname 'production_db' ); Create user mapping \u00b6 A user mapping is a relationship between the user you're connecting with to PostgresML and a user that exists on your production database. FDW will use this mapping to talk to your database when it wants to read some data. CREATE USER MAPPING FOR pgml_user SERVER your_production_db OPTIONS ( user 'your_production_db_user' , password 'your_production_db_user_password' ); At this point, when you connect to PostgresML using the example pgml_user and then query data in your production database using FDW, it'll use the user your_production_db_user to connect to your DB and fetch the data. Make sure that your_production_db_user has SELECT permissions on the tables you want to query and the USAGE permissions on the schema. Import the tables \u00b6 The final step is import your production database tables into PostgresML by creating a foreign schema mapping. This mapping will tell PostgresML which tables are available in your database. The quickest way is to import all of them, like so: IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA public FROM SERVER your_production_db INTO public ; This will import all tables from your production DB public schema into the public schema in PostgresML. The tables are now available for querying in PostgresML. Usage \u00b6 PostgresML snapshots the data before training on it, so every time you run pgml.train with a relation_name argument, the data will be fetched from the foreign data wrapper and imported into PostgresML. FDWs are reasonably good at fetching only the data specified by the VIEW , so if you place sufficient limits on your dataset in the CREATE VIEW statement, e.g. train on the last two weeks of data, or something similar, FDWs will do its best to fetch only the last two weeks of data in an efficient manner, leaving the rest behind on the primary. Logical replication (100GB - 10TB) \u00b6 Logical replication is a replication mechanism that's been available since PostgreSQL 10. It allows to copy entire tables and schemas from any database into PostgresML and keeping them up-to-date in real time fairly cheaply as the data in production changes. This is suitable for medium to large PostgreSQL deployments (e.g. 100GB - 10TB). Logical replication is designed as a pub/sub system, where your production database is the publisher and PostgresML is the subscriber. As data in your database changes, it is streamed into PostgresML in milliseconds, which is very similar to how Postgres streaming replication works as well. The setup is slightly more involved than Foreign Data Wrappers, and is documented below. All queries must be run as a superuser. WAL \u00b6 First, make sure that your production DB has logical replication enabled. For this, it has to be on PostgreSQL 10 or above and also have wal_level configuration set to logical . SQL Output SHOW wal_level ; wal_level ----------- logical (1 row) If this is not the case, you'll need to change it and restart the server. Publication \u00b6 The publication is created on your production DB and configures which tables are replicated using logical replication. To replicate all tables in your public schema, you can run this: CREATE PUBLICATION all_tables FOR ALL TABLES ; Schema \u00b6 Logical replication does not copy the schema, so it needs to be copied manually in advance; pg_dump is great for this: # Dump the schema from your production DB pg_dump \\ postgres://username:password@production-db.example.com/production_db \\ --schema-only \\ --no-owner > schema.sql # Import the schema in PostgresML psql \\ postgres://username:password@postgresml.example.com/postgresml_db \\ -f schema.sql Subscription \u00b6 The subscription is created in your PostgresML database. To replicate all the tables we marked in the previous step, run: CREATE SUBSCRIPTION all_tables CONNECTION 'postgres://superuser:password@production-database.example.com/production_db' PUBLICATION all_tables ; As soon as you run this, logical replication will begin. It will start by copying all the data from your production database into PostgresML. That will take a while, depending on database size, network connection and hardware performance. Each table will be copied individually and the process is parallelized. Once the copy is complete, logical replication will synchronize and will replicate the data from your production database into PostgresML in real-time. Schema changes \u00b6 Logical replication has one notable limitation: it does not replicate schema (table) changes. If you change a table in your production DB in an incompatible way, e.g. by adding a column, the replication will break. To remediate this, when you're performing the schema change, make the change first in PostgresML and then in your production database. Native installation (10TB and beyond) \u00b6 For databases that are very large, e.g. 10TB+, we recommend you install the extension directly into your database. This option is available for databases of all sizes, but we recognize that many small to medium databases run on managed services, e.g. RDS, which don't allow this mechanism.","title":"Distributed Training"},{"location":"user_guides/setup/distributed_training/#distributed-training","text":"Depending on the size of your dataset and its change frequency, you may want to offload training (or inference) to secondary PostgreSQL servers to avoid excessive load on your primary.

Every time the pgml.train() function receives the relation_name and y_column_name arguments, it will create a new snapshot of the relation (table) and save it in the pgml schema. To train another algorithm on the same dataset, omit the two arguments. PostgresML will reuse the latest snapshot with the new algorithm. Tip Try experimenting with multiple algorithms to explore their performance characteristics on your dataset. It's often hard to know which algorithm will be the best.","title":"Comparing Algorithms"},{"location":"user_guides/training/algorithm_selection/#dashboard","text":"The PostgresML dashboard makes it easy to compare various algorithms on your dataset.

We currently support random and grid search algorithms, and k-fold cross validation. API \u00b6 The parameters passed to pgml.train() easily allow one to perform hyperparameter tuning. The three parameters relevant to this are: search , search_params and search_args . Parameter Example search grid search_params {\"alpha\": [0.1, 0.2, 0.5] } search_args {\"n_iter\": 10 } Example SELECT * FROM pgml . train ( 'Handwritten Digit Image Classifier' , algorithm => 'xgboost' , search => 'grid' , search_params => '{ \"max_depth\": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], \"n_estimators\": [20, 40, 80, 160] }' ); You may pass any of the arguments listed in the algorithms documentation as hyperparameters. See Algorithms for the complete list of algorithms and their associated hyperparameters. Search Algorithms \u00b6 We currently support two search algorithms: random and grid . Algorithm Description grid Trains every permutation of search_params using a cartesian product. random Randomly samples search_params up to n_iter number of iterations provided in search_args . Analysis \u00b6 PostgresML automatically selects the optimal set of hyperparameters for the model, and that combination is highlighted in the Dashboard, among all other search candidates. The impact of each hyperparameter is measured against the key metric ( r2 for regression and f1 for classification), as well as the training and test times. Tip In our example case, it's interesting that as max_depth increases, the \"Test Score\" on the key metric trends lower, so the smallest value of max_depth is chosen to maximize the \"Test Score\". Luckily, the smallest max_depth values also have the fastest \"Fit Time\", indicating that we pay less for training these higher quality models. It's a little less obvious how the different values n_estimators and learning_rate impact the test score. We may want to rerun our search and zoom in on our the search space to get more insight. Performance \u00b6 In our example above, the grid search will train len(max_depth) * len(n_estimators) * len(learning_rate) = 6 * 4 * 4 = 96 combinations to compare all possible permutations of search_params . It only took about a minute on my computer because we're using optimized Rust/C++ XGBoost bindings, but you can delete some values if you want to speed things up even further.

When used for the first time in a project, pgml.train() function requires the task parameter, which can be either regression or classification . The task determines the relevant metrics and analysis performed on the data. All models trained within the project will refer to those metrics and analysis for benchmarking and deployment. The first time it's called, the function will also require a relation_name and y_column_name . The two arguments will be used to create the first snapshot of training and test data. By default, 25% of the data (specified by the test_size parameter) will be randomly sampled to measure the performance of the model after the algorithm has been trained on the 75% of the data. Tip Postgres supports named arguments in functions, so you can easily recognize them and pass them as needed: SELECT * FROM pgml . train ( 'My Classification Project' , algorithm => 'xgboost' ); Future calls to pgml.train() may restate the same task for a project or omit it, but they can't change it. Projects manage their deployed model using the metrics relevant to a particular task (e.g. r2 or f1 ), so changing it would mean some models in the project are no longer directly comparable. In that case, it's better to start a new project. Note If you'd like to train multiple models on the same snapshot, follow up calls to pgml.train() may omit the relation_name , y_column_name , test_size and test_sampling arguments to reuse identical data with multiple algorithms or hyperparameters. The snapshot is always saved after training runs if any follow up analysis required. Getting Training Data \u00b6 A large part of the machine learning workflow is acquiring, cleaning, and preparing data for training algorithms. Naturally, we think Postgres is a great place to store your data. For the purpose of this example, we'll load a toy dataset, the classic handwritten digits image collection, from scikit-learn. SQL Output SELECT * FROM pgml . load_dataset ( 'digits' ); pgml=# SELECT * FROM pgml.load_dataset('digits'); NOTICE: table \"digits\" does not exist, skipping table_name | rows -------------+------ pgml.digits | 1797 (1 row) This NOTICE can safely be ignored. PostgresML attempts to do a clean reload by dropping the pgml.digits table if it exists. The first time this command is run, the table does not exist. PostgresML loaded the Digits dataset into the pgml.digits table. You can examine the 2D arrays of image data, as well as the label in the target column: SQL Output SELECT target , image FROM pgml . digits LIMIT 5 ; target | image --------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0 | {{0,0,5,13,9,1,0,0},{0,0,13,15,10,15,5,0},{0,3,15,2,0,11,8,0},{0,4,12,0,0,8,8,0},{0,5,8,0,0,9,8,0},{0,4,11,0,1,12,7,0},{0,2,14,5,10,12,0,0},{0,0,6,13,10,0,0,0}} 1 | {{0,0,0,12,13,5,0,0},{0,0,0,11,16,9,0,0},{0,0,3,15,16,6,0,0},{0,7,15,16,16,2,0,0},{0,0,1,16,16,3,0,0},{0,0,1,16,16,6,0,0},{0,0,1,16,16,6,0,0},{0,0,0,11,16,10,0,0}} 2 | {{0,0,0,4,15,12,0,0},{0,0,3,16,15,14,0,0},{0,0,8,13,8,16,0,0},{0,0,1,6,15,11,0,0},{0,1,8,13,15,1,0,0},{0,9,16,16,5,0,0,0},{0,3,13,16,16,11,5,0},{0,0,0,3,11,16,9,0}} 3 | {{0,0,7,15,13,1,0,0},{0,8,13,6,15,4,0,0},{0,2,1,13,13,0,0,0},{0,0,2,15,11,1,0,0},{0,0,0,1,12,12,1,0},{0,0,0,0,1,10,8,0},{0,0,8,4,5,14,9,0},{0,0,7,13,13,9,0,0}} 4 | {{0,0,0,1,11,0,0,0},{0,0,0,7,8,0,0,0},{0,0,1,13,6,2,2,0},{0,0,7,15,0,9,8,0},{0,5,16,10,0,16,6,0},{0,4,15,16,13,16,1,0},{0,0,0,3,15,10,0,0},{0,0,0,2,16,4,0,0}} (5 rows) Training a Model \u00b6 Now that we've got data, we're ready to train a model using an algorithm.

Text Classification Example \u00b6 DistilBERT is a small, fast, cheap and light Transformer model based on the BERT architecture. It can be fine tuned on specific datasets to learn further nuance between positive and negative examples. For this example, we'll fine tune distilbert-base-uncased on the IMBD dataset, which is a list of movie reviews along with a positive or negative label. Without tuning, DistilBERT classifies every single movie review as positive , and has a F 1 score of 0.367, which is about what you'd expect for a relatively useless classifier. However, after training for a single epoch (takes about 10 minutes on an Nvidia 1080 TI), the F 1 jumps to 0.928 which is a huge improvement, indicating DistilBERT can now fairly accurately predict sentiment from IMDB reviews. Further training for another epoch only results in a very minor improvement to 0.931, and the 3 rd epoch is flat, also at 0.931 which indicates DistilBERT is unlikely to continue learning more about this particular dataset with additional training. You can view the results of each model, like those trained from scratch, in the dashboard. Once our model has been fine tuned on the dataset, it'll be saved and deployed with a Project visible in the Dashboard, just like models built from simpler algorithms.

Many state of the art deep learning architectures have been published and made available for download. You will want to browse all the models available to find the perfect solution for your dataset and task . We'll demonstrate some of the tasks that are immediately available to users of your database upon installation: translation , sentiment analysis , summarization , question answering and text generation . Examples \u00b6 All of the tasks and models demonstrated here can be customized by passing additional arguments to the Pipeline initializer or call. You'll find additional links to documentation in the examples below. The Hugging Face Pipeline API is exposed in Postgres via: transformer.sql 1 2 3 4 5 pgml . transform ( task TEXT OR JSONB , -- task name or full pipeline initializer arguments call JSONB , -- additional call arguments alongside the inputs inputs TEXT [] OR BYTEA [] -- inputs for inference ) This is roughly equivalent to the following Python: transformer.py 1 2 3 4 import transformers def transform ( task , call , inputs ): return transformers . pipeline ( ** task )( inputs , ** call ) Most pipelines operate on TEXT[] inputs, but some require binary BYTEA[] data like audio classifiers. inputs can be SELECT ed from tables in the database, or they may be passed in directly with the query. The output of this call is a JSONB structure that is task specific. See the Postgres JSON reference for ways to process this output dynamically. Tip Models will be downloaded and stored locally on disk after the first call. They are also cached per connection to improve repeated calls in a single session. To free that memory, you'll need to close your connection. You may want to establish dedicated credentials and connection pools via pgcat or pgbouncer for larger models that have billions of parameters. You may also pass {\"cache\": false} in the JSON call args to prevent this behavior. Translation \u00b6 There are thousands of different pre-trained translation models between language pairs. They generally take a single input string in the \"from\" language, and translate it into the \"to\" language as a result of the call. PostgresML transformations provide a batch interface where you can pass an array of TEXT to process in a single call for efficiency. Not all language pairs have a default task name like this example of English to French. In those cases, you'll need to specify the desired model by name. You can see how to specify a model in the next example . Because this is a batch call with 2 inputs, we'll get 2 outputs in the JSONB. For a translation from English to French with the default pre-trained model: SQL Result 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 SELECT pgml . transform ( 'translation_en_to_fr' , inputs => ARRAY [ 'Welcome to the future!' , 'Where have you been all this time?' ] ) AS french ; 1 2 3 4 5 6 french ------------------------------------------------------------ [ { \"translation_text\" : \"Bienvenue \u00e0 l'avenir!\" } , { \"translation_text\" : \"O\u00f9 \u00eates-vous all\u00e9 tout ce temps?\" } ] See translation documentation for more options. Sentiment Analysis \u00b6 Sentiment analysis is one use of text-classification , but there are many others . This model returns both a label classification [\"POSITIVE\", \"NEUTRAL\", \"NEGATIVE\"] , as well as the score where 0.0 is perfectly negative, and 1.0 is perfectly positive. This example demonstrates specifying the model to be used rather than the task. The roberta-large-mnli model specifies the task of sentiment-analysis in it's default configuration, so we may omit it from the parameters.

We'll show how to fine tune models on your data in the next step. Summarization \u00b6 Sometimes we need all the nuanced detail, but sometimes it's nice to get to the point. Summarization can reduce a very long and complex document to a few sentences. One studied application is reducing legal bills passed by Congress into a plain english summary. Hollywood may also need some intelligence to reduce a full synopsis down to a pithy blurb for movies like Inception.

Question Answering \u00b6 Question Answering extracts an answer from a given context. Recent progress has enabled models to also specify if the answer is present in the context at all. If you were trying to build a general question answering system, you could first turn the question into a keyword search against Wikipedia articles, and then use a model to retrieve the correct answer from the top hit.
